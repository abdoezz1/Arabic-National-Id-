# Arabic-National-Id-
# Arabic National ID Extraction System

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is an **AI-powered system** for extracting information from Egyptian national ID cards.  
It uses **two YOLO-based object detection models** and **OCR** to accurately detect and read fields such as:

- **First Name**
- **Last Name**
- **Address1**
- **Address2**
- **National ID number**
  
The pipeline is designed to handle **real-world card images** with varying lighting, angles, and backgrounds.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Field Label Detection** â€“ Detects predefined text fields (e.g., name, address) using YOLO.
- **Digit Detection** â€“ Uses a separate YOLO model to detect each digit of the national ID number.
- **OCR Integration** â€“ Uses EasyOCR for text extraction from detected fields.
- **Modular Pipeline** â€“ Easy to extend for new fields or improved models.
- **High Accuracy** â€“ Improved performance over baseline OCR methods.
